description: Generates a minimal, self-maintaining CLAUDE.md for projects through auto-detection and developer interview. Covers project identity, do/don't rules, hooks, and self-maintenance. Use when starting a new project or adding Claude Code support to an existing one

# Initializing Projects

Generate a focused CLAUDE.md that gives Claude the context it actually needs — and nothing more.
Agents are smart enough to figure out most things from the code.
The file should capture what they cannot infer: project identity, business context, and hard-won lessons.

## Reference Files

| File | Read When |
|------|-----------|
| `references/claude-md-patterns.md` | Constructing the CLAUDE.md or reviewing examples of effective minimal configs |

## Philosophy

Keep the CLAUDE.md minimal.
Agents read the code, `package.json`, config files, and directory structure on their own.
Only add what they would get wrong or waste time figuring out.

**Include:**
- What the project is, who it's for, and why it exists (mission/vision)
- Do/don't rules for things that have tripped the agent up or need clarification
- Non-obvious conventions that differ from common patterns
- Key files only if they are novel or not where you'd expect them

**Exclude:**
- Tech stack descriptions the agent can read from config files
- Detailed repo structure (it changes, and the agent can explore)
- Generic programming advice
- Standard framework patterns Claude already understands

The file grows over time as the agent (and you) discover gotchas.
Start small — a 20-line CLAUDE.md is better than a 200-line one full of noise.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Auto-Detection

Scan the project to understand the landscape.
This informs the interview — skip questions you can answer from config files.

**Detect:**
- Package manager and ecosystem (lock files, `packageManager` field, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, workspace configs like `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `nx.json`, etc.)
- Framework (dependencies in `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, config files like `next.config.*`)
- Test runner (jest/vitest/pytest config, `scripts.test`, `tests/` directory)
- Linter/formatter (eslint, prettier, biome, ruff, black configs)
- Existing CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md — if found, warn and ask whether to merge or replace. Merge = read existing content, preserve user-written sections, add new sections from the template that don't exist yet. Present the merged result for user approval before writing
- README.md — extract project description

Present findings in a concise summary.
Ask the user to confirm or correct before proceeding.

### Phase 2: Interview

Fill gaps that auto-detection cannot cover.
Go as deep as the project warrants — simple projects need 2-3 questions, complex ones may need a longer conversation.

**Core questions:**
- What does this project do? Who is it for? What's the mission? (skip if README is clear)
- Are there conventions or patterns that differ from what you'd expect? (naming, architecture, data flow)
- What has tripped you (or previous Claude sessions) up? What keeps going wrong?
- Any business decisions or constraints that affect how code should be written?
- Are there key files or areas of the codebase that are non-obvious or tricky?

Do not ask questions the code answers.
Do not cap the interview artificially — if the user keeps sharing useful context, keep going.
When the user signals they're done, move on.

### Phase 3: Generate CLAUDE.md

Generate a minimal `CLAUDE.md` at the project root.
Only include sections with real content — omit empty sections entirely.

```markdown
## What This Is
[Project description — what it does, who it's for, why it exists]
[Mission/vision if the user shared one]

## Do / Don't
- Do: [specific convention or pattern the agent should follow]
- Don't: [specific thing that has caused problems or is explicitly wrong]
[Add more as discovered during development]

## Known Issues
<!-- Populated by Claude — remove entries when fixed -->

## Decision Log
<!-- Key business/project decisions only, not obvious code choices -->
```

**Conditional sections** (only add if the user raised them):
- **Key Files** — only for files that are non-obvious or in unexpected locations
- **Gotchas** — specific traps or footguns in the codebase
- **Commands** — only if they differ from standard (`pnpm test`, `pnpm dev`, etc.) or have unusual flags

Do not add:
- A "Project Structure" section listing directories the agent can discover itself
- A "Development" section restating `package.json` scripts verbatim
- A "Coding Conventions" section with generic rules the agent already follows
- Tech stack descriptions ("This project uses Next.js 14 with TypeScript") — the agent reads `package.json`

The self-maintenance rules from the user's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` handle plan updates, known issues, and decision logging.
Do not duplicate those rules in the project CLAUDE.md unless the user's global config is missing them.

### Phase 4: Generate Hooks

Create `.claude/settings.json` with auto-format hooks based on the detected formatter.

**If Prettier:** `npx prettier --write $CLAUDE_FILE_PATH 2>/dev/null || true`
**If Biome:** `npx @biomejs/biome format --write $CLAUDE_FILE_PATH 2>/dev/null || true`
**If Ruff:** `ruff format $CLAUDE_FILE_PATH 2>/dev/null || true`
**If Black:** `black $CLAUDE_FILE_PATH 2>/dev/null || true`

Wrap in a PostToolUse hook matching `Write|Edit`.

If no formatter is detected, suggest one appropriate for the stack but do not force it. Defaults: Prettier for JS/TS, Ruff for Python, gofmt for Go, rustfmt for Rust.

`.claude/settings.json` should be committed to git so project hooks are shared with the team.
If `.claude/settings.local.json` exists (machine-specific overrides), ensure it's in `.gitignore`.

### Phase 5: Verification

Read back every generated file and confirm:
- CLAUDE.md is concise and contains only non-obvious information
- Hooks point to the correct formatter
- No generic boilerplate was included

Present a summary listing all files created and their purpose.
Flag anything that looks wrong or needs manual adjustment.

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| Listing tech stack the agent can detect | Only note what's surprising or non-standard |
| Detailed repo structure that will go stale | Let the agent explore; call out only non-obvious key files |
| Generic advice ("write clean code") | Specific do/don't rules from real experience |
| Overwriting existing CLAUDE.md without asking | Warn and offer to merge |
| Padding with empty sections | Omit sections that have no real content |
| Capping the interview prematurely | Let the user share as much context as they want |
| Duplicating global self-maintenance rules | Check if they exist in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` first |
