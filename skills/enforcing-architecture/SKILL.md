# Enforcing Architecture

Set up automated architecture enforcement that catches violations on every file edit — not documentation agents might skip.
The goal: a check script wired into hooks, with educational error messages telling agents how to fix violations.

## Reference Files

| File | Read When |
|------|-----------|
| `references/layer-patterns.md` | Detecting architecture style or suggesting layer boundaries for a specific stack |

## Workflow

```
- [ ] Phase 1: Detect architecture signals
- [ ] Phase 2: Interview for boundaries and rules
- [ ] Phase 3: Generate ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] Phase 4: Generate check script
- [ ] Phase 5: Wire into hooks
- [ ] Phase 6: Verify
```

### Phase 1: Detect Architecture Signals

Scan the project for layered directory patterns, existing architecture docs (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/adr/`), dependency patterns (sample 5-10 source files), existing enforcement configs (`dependency-cruiser`, `eslint-plugin-boundaries`), and framework conventions.
Read `references/layer-patterns.md` to match detected signals against known architecture styles.

**If existing enforcement is found:**
- Present what's already configured
- Ask if the user wants to extend it, replace it, or skip this skill
- Don't duplicate existing enforcement

Present findings concisely. State assumptions — don't ask what the agent can infer.

### Phase 2: Interview

Fill gaps detection couldn't cover. Adapt depth to project complexity.

**Core questions (skip those answered by detection):**

- What are the layers/boundaries? Present detected layers, ask user to confirm, rename, or add missing ones
- What is the allowed dependency direction? (e.g., "controllers can import services, services can import models, but not the reverse")
- Are there shared/utility layers any layer can import? (e.g., `utils/`, `lib/`, `types/`)
- Are there cross-cutting exceptions? (e.g., logging, error handling)
- Should rules apply to the whole `src/` tree or specific subdirectories?

**For complex projects, also ask:**
- Are there module/feature boundaries? (e.g., `features/auth/` cannot import from `features/billing/`)
- Are there external dependency restrictions? (e.g., "only the data layer may import the ORM")

### Phase 3: Generate ARCHITECTURE.md

Create `ARCHITECTURE.md` at the project root.
If one already exists, ask whether to merge into it or replace it.

Include these sections (omit any that don't apply):
- **Layer Diagram** — simple ASCII showing layers and allowed dependency direction
- **Layers table** — columns: Layer, Directory, May Import From, Must Not Import From
- **Shared Modules** — directories any layer can import
- **Rules** — specific rules with reasoning
- **Exceptions** — agreed-upon exceptions with reasoning

### Phase 4: Generate Check Script

Generate a check script that validates imports against the dependency rules.

**Key constraints:**
- **Standard library only** — no external dependencies, must work without install
- **Educational error messages** — each violation states what's wrong, which rule, and how to fix:
  ```
  VIOLATION: src/models/user.ts imports from src/controllers/auth.ts
  Rule: Models must not import from Controllers
  Fix: Move the shared logic to src/services/ or src/utils/
  ```
- **Accept file paths as arguments** — single file (for hooks) or no args (full project scan)
- **Ignore test and config files** by default
- **Resolve path aliases** — read `tsconfig.json`/`jsconfig.json` `paths` to map aliases like `@/lib/...` to actual directories before checking layer membership
- Match the project's language (Python script for Python projects, Node.js for JS/TS, shell as fallback)
- Place at `scripts/check-architecture.{py,mjs,sh}`

**For projects already using `dependency-cruiser` or `eslint-plugin-boundaries`:**
Generate a config file for the existing tool instead, then wire it into hooks.

### Phase 5: Wire into Hooks

Connect the check script so it runs automatically.

**Option A: PostToolUse hook (recommended for Claude Code)**

Add to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "command": "scripts/check-architecture.mjs \"$CLAUDE_FILE_PATH\" 2>/dev/null || true"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Hook stdout is shown to the agent, so violations appear as inline warnings.
Remove `|| true` for strict mode (blocks the edit on violation).

**Option B: Pre-commit hook** — add to `husky`/`lint-staged` if the project uses them.

**Option C: CI check** — complement to hooks for team enforcement.

Recommend Option A for Claude Code users, Option C as a complement for teams.

### Phase 6: Verify

1. Run the check script with no arguments (full project scan)
2. If pre-existing violations are found, ask the user: fix now, add as exceptions, or ignore
3. Test the hook by editing a file and confirming the check runs
4. Verify `ARCHITECTURE.md` is accurate

Present a summary of generated files:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — layer boundaries and rules
- `scripts/check-architecture.{ext}` — enforcement script
- `.claude/settings.json` update — hook configuration (if chosen)

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| Over-granular layers (10+ layers) | Start with 3-5 layers; split later if needed |
| Blocking hooks that frustrate the agent | Default to warning mode (`\|\| true`); let users opt into strict |
| Checking every file on every edit | Check only the edited file via `$CLAUDE_FILE_PATH` in hooks |
